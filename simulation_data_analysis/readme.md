## Pre-Test Design
To test the feasibility of the experiment, we conducted a small-scale pre-test.

**Pre-test Groups**

We selected five groups from the formal experiment for the pre-test, including the Human Novice Therapist Group, Appointment-based 50-minute AI Therapist Group, AI Therapist Anytime Anywhere Group and Control Group.

**Participants Recruitment** 

_Patients_

Patients were recruited through social media platforms such as Xiaohongshu and WeChat, using the same screening process as described in the report. A total of 33 individuals registered. They were required to complete the SCL-90 scale. We used the Chinese norm with one standard deviation above the mean as the highest threshold, which allowed us to screen out 27 participants. After further confirmation of their willingness to join by our researchers, 25 participants were ultimately included. These participants were randomly assigned to one of the five groups by a researcher.

_Human Therapists_

As described in the report, we recruited two novice human therapists using the same recruitment process and criteria.

# Before-Experiment Survey & Analysis


# Conversation Data & Analysis
Based on the conversation data collected from the pre-test up to November 23, we calculated the conversation characteristics of participants in each group, including duration (min) and message exchanges, as shown in the table below.

|Group Name|Type|Avg.(std)|Median|Min|Max|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Novice Human|Duration|56.87(7.76)|55.55|45.63|69.87|
||Messages Sent by Patients|25.60(4.67)|26|17|31|
|50min AI|Duration|52.88(15.54)|57.74|8.08|66.65|
||Messages Sent by Patients|56.30(36.86)|44.50|10|145|
|24/7 AI|Duration|6.63(6.57)|4.22|0.82|25.85|
||Messages Sent by Patients|8.07(6.54)|6|3|30|

As the conversation data has not yet been anonymized, we have only uploaded the simulated conversation data (in the _conversation_data_ folder), which is formatted in the same way as the real data. Additionally, the _conversation_data_analysis.py_ script supports the analysis of characteristics for the simulated conversation data.
