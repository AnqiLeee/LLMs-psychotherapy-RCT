## Pre-Test
To test the feasibility of the experiment, we conducted a small-scale pre-test.

**Pre-test Groups**

We selected four groups from the formal experiment for the pre-test, including the Human Novice Therapist Group, Appointment-based 50-minute AI Therapist Group, AI Therapist Anytime Anywhere Group, and Control Group.

**Participants Recruitment** 

_Patients_

Patients were recruited through social media platforms such as Xiaohongshu and WeChat, using the same screening process as described in the report. A total of 33 individuals registered. They were required to complete the SCL-90 scale. We used the Chinese norm with one standard deviation above the mean as the highest threshold, which allowed us to screen out 27 participants. After further confirmation of their willingness to join by our researchers, 25 participants were ultimately included. These participants were randomly assigned to one of the five groups by a researcher.

_Human Therapists_

As described in the report, we recruited two human therapists using the same recruitment process and criteria.
